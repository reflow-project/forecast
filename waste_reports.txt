The data shows that more was sold then purchased. So we dont throw anything away actually.
We redistribute the sellings amount below zero evenly on the original selling dates.
So they can be taken into account calculating the waste of a potential later delivery.

Waste report for Product: raspberry delivered on 2022-01-16 05:28:00
Quantity: 19.9 kgs
Average shelf life: 2 days
Should all be sold by: 2022-01-18 05:28:00

The data shows sellings after assumed shelf life which should be taken into account calculating the waste.
All sellings until next purchase will be taken into account: 2022-01-23 05:10:00
Thats 4 days 23:42:00 after the expected shelf life.
If that seems unrealistic maybe shelf life should be adjusted ...
